        <h3>The center encourages and provides opportunities for “give back to the society” initiatives among beneficiaries. The major areas are:</h3>
        <h3>Literacy project</h3>
        <p>The Literacy Project, formerly known as the Obiagu project, is an initiative of Uzommiri Study Centre. The goal of the project is to improve the literacy level of the children of Obiagu community, a sub urban area in Enugu and its environs by complementing the education they receive in their schools, with a focus on the girl child. Since its inception in 2017, the project has impacted the lives of over 200 beneficiaries, both primary and secondary school girls within the class range of primary 3 - SS3, through the teaching of Mathematics, English Language and the Sciences using a personalized approach. It also seeks to improve and promote the culture of reading amongst the children, by providing them with standard story books and novels, as well as a comfortable reading space where they could study. Other activities like reading exercises, essay competitions, spelling bee events etc, are also organized by the volunteers who identify with this project, many of whom are beneficiaries of the formation given by the centre for different age groups, to further improve the reading and writing skills of the girls in the literacy program.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to these, skill acquisition classes are given to encourage the participants to become financially self-sustaining soon after their basic education . Over the years, participants have been taught the art of hair-dressing, soap making, cookery, housekeeping and basic computer skills.</p>

        <p>Apart from the literacy project at Obiagu community, Uzommiri continues to organize similar projects at other communities within and beyond Enugu. Some of which include medical outreaches, literacy and numeracy classes as well as skill acquisition sessions. The communities in Enugu state which have been beneficiaries of such services in recent times include; Umulumgbe, Eke and Awlaw.</p>

        <h3>Ayudante Mentoring Programme</h3>
        <p>A six - eight month programme for female undergraduate students in their second to final year of study, with a two-fold aim. "Ayudante" is a spanish word meaning "assistant", "helper" "aide" or "companion", different words which reflect a personal coach or guide. These express in different ways the core part of this mentoring and volunteering program, which is to provide opportunities for young people who are interested in having professional mentors to guide them on their chosen path so as to achieve a balanced personality and impact younger students. Since mentoring is a sure path for the growth of great leaders, as well as a stabilizing influence for having a balanced personality and changing the world. Besides having a mentor assigned to them, participants go through sessions covering key areas of personal development, including: Emotional Intelligence, Personal Time Management, Teamwork, Communication, Home and Financial Responsibility, etc. All these serve to prepare them for the second part of the programme which is to become mentors to other people, which highlights the volunteering part of this programme.</p>
