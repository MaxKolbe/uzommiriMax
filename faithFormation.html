            <p>Iwollo Conference Centre, situated at the outskirts of Enugu City in the Eastern part of Nigeria provides a tranquil environment, lovely company and even better accommodation to stimulate a deeper intimacy with God during the annual retreats organized there. The Conference Centre also provides accommodation for in-house workshops, hospitality services, sports facilities for guests. The necessary intimacy fostered during the retreats is further fueled by meditations given by a priest of Opus Dei, short talks on christian living, holy mass, the sacrament of reconciliation to give us a clearer perspective on life, personal reflection and personal conversations with the priest.</p>
